## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code:

- **Be respectful**: Treat everyone with respect and kindness
- **Be inclusive**: Welcome newcomers and help them feel included

- **Be collaborative**: Work together towards common goals

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git version control
- Django knowledge (basic to intermediate)
- Understanding of M-Pesa API concepts
- Experience with REST APIs

### Setup Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mpesa.git
   cd mpesa
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your test credentials
   ```

5. **Run initial setup**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py collectstatic
   python manage.py test
   ```

## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

We use a simplified Git Flow:

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Feature development branches
- `hotfix/*`: Critical bug fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches

### Feature Development Workflow

1. **Create feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Develop your feature**
   - Write code following our standards
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   python manage.py test
   python test_security.py
   python test_integration.py
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

5. **Push and create pull request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some project-specific additions:

```python
# Good: Clear, descriptive names
def validate_mpesa_callback(request_data):
    """Validate M-Pesa callback request data."""
    pass

# Bad: Unclear abbreviations
def val_cb(data):
    pass
```

### Django Conventions

- Use Django's built-in features when possible
- Follow Django's model, view, template patterns
- Use Django forms for validation
- Implement proper error handling

### Documentation Standards

- All functions must have docstrings
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Update README.md for new features
- Add inline comments for complex logic

```python
def process_payment(phone_number, amount, reference):
    """Process M-Pesa STK Push payment.
    
    Args:
        phone_number (str): Customer phone number in format 254XXXXXXXXX
        amount (int): Payment amount in KES
        reference (str): Unique payment reference
        
    Returns:
        dict: Payment response with status and transaction details
        
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If input parameters are invalid
        PaymentError: If payment processing fails
    """
    pass
```

### Security Standards

- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PINs)
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Validate all callback requests
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Coverage Requirements

- Minimum 80% code coverage
- All new features must include tests
- Critical security functions require comprehensive tests

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
   ```python
   class TestPhoneValidation(TestCase):
       def test_valid_phone_formats(self):
           self.assertEqual(validate_phone("0712345678"), "254712345678")
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints
   ```python
   class TestPaymentAPI(APITestCase):
       def test_stk_push_success(self):
           response = self.client.post('/payments/checkout/', data)
           self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
   ```

3. **Security Tests**: Test security features
   ```python
   class TestCallbackSecurity(TestCase):
       def test_invalid_ip_rejected(self):
           # Test IP whitelisting
           pass
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
python manage.py test

# Specific test file
python manage.py test mpesa.tests.test_payments

# With coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report -m
```

## Security Guidelines

### Secure Development Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before database storage
   - Use Django forms for validation

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Use Django's authentication framework
   - Validate all API requests

3. **Data Protection**
   - Hash sensitive data
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement proper logging without exposing secrets

4. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose internal errors to users
   - Log errors securely
   - Provide helpful but safe error messages

### Security Testing

```bash
# Run security tests
python test_security.py

# Check for common vulnerabilities
bandit -r .

# Dependency security scan
safety check
```

# Enable debug mode for development
export DEBUG=True

# Use Django shell for testing
python manage.py shell
